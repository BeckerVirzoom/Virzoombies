VIRZOOM SDK 1.6

The VirZOOM SDK allows you to quickly create and adapt games that talk to the VirZOOM Bike Controller. It provides access to all the sensor data from the bike, including speed, pedal direction, buttons, resistance setting, and heartrate. It also includes a high-level player controller, using our patent-pending motion controls, that combine the bike sensors with your head movement to comfortably move through large VR worlds.

Please see http://virzoom.com/manual?manual_tag=manual_sdk_description for SDK documentation, and http://virzoom.com/forums/forum-27.html for SDK discussion. Usage of this SDK and the VirZOOM Bike Controller is governed by the License Agreement at http://virzoom.com/eula.htm.

Compatible with Unity 5.4.0+ and Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Playstation VR, Daydream, and GearVR.
